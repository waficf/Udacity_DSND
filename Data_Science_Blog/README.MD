# Write a Data Science Blog

## Description
This is an open end project where I attempt to analyze the data of the Airbnb Seattle listing as part of the Udacity data seince nanodegree program. 

## Questions I plan to answer
1. What are the most important features that affect the host revenue?
2. Is it a winner takes all, in other words are the top listings harvesting more than 1/3 of the total revenue?
3. How much do the hosts make and whom are the top earners? and is it a side business or a full time job?
4. How do the top earning listings compare to the worst earning listings in terms of features?
5. What are the most popular and most expensive neighborhoods in Seattle?
