When you think of development, the idea of thousand lines of code can be intimidating, but in this course we will learn the basics of data analysis using Anaconda Framework without the need to have more than 10 lines.

Another reason for creating this code is that most courses are bottom up learnng where they start with the fundementals and build up but here we will start with a well written Jupiter notebook that includes all you need for your daily task and seeing the big picture you can then break it down to undertsand the basics




## Not machine learning, just data cleaning from A-Z with Pandas
These days, every where you look, people are talking about machine learning and when look at any online course most of the content is about statistics, data modeling and how to use the ML packages when in reality every data analysis expert will confess that the majority of work is done in data cleaning. Another reason for creating this code is that most courses are bottom up learnng where they start with the fundementals and build up but here we will start with a well written Jupiter notebook that includes all you need for your daily task and seeing the big picture you can then break it down to undertsand the basics
